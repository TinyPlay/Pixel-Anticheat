/*
 * Pixel Anti Cheat
 * ======================================================
 * This library allows you to organize a simple anti-cheat
 * for your game and take care of data security. You can
 * use it in your projects for free.
 *
 * Note that it does not guarantee 100% protection for
 * your game. If you are developing a multiplayer game -
 * never trust the client and check everything on
 * the server.
